# OneDay
An app to plan one day's task, multiple timer
[Get it from Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.cmu.cs.oneday)

#Basic Idea:

###Do you know how many todo Items you can finish by the end of today?
###Do you know how many minutes are left for you to finish them?

####How about making a plan? 
####Are you comfortable with your plan?
####Are you confident enough to finish all the items you list in the plan?
####....
####Are you tired of this?


##This app might be a little help 
(trust me, I know how ugly it looks right now =_= ,I will definitely work on this in October once I get a hand for this)

###What does it do:

List the items you have to do for today, and give an loose estimation on the time you might spend on them;
It will tell you how many time is left for today, and this time will be consumed after you add new items to the list;

This way, you will know roughly how many todo items you may finish by the end of today.

Don't hesitate to put everything here, like: having lunch, taking a nap, etc.

Start on the item you want to work on for now, focus only on it, and the timer will show you how many time you have spent on this item, and how many time is left for this item as you estimated.

Once you finish the item, swip right to mark it as "Finished"
If you changed your mind, you can easily delete an item by swiping left.

If you click on the menu: you can see the actual time you spent on every item that you have finished.
